      content="A young shepherd boy living between the no mans land of civilzation and beyond is taken and made slave by an invading army enroute to his homeland. Led by an undefeated general with a penchant for cruelty, this unassuming adolescent careens his way into the commanders good graces through a witless charm. Finding out only all too late that the little shepherd boy was not at all what he had seemed, the unconquerable general and his army are led to their doom."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
